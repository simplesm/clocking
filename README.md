# clocking
clocking is a pocket time stamp clock designed as an iOS app for many situations. With only one-click you can start tracking your workday, yoga session, pomodoro or any other task that you freqently do.  Once set it reminds us when time is up. Clocking saves those time stamps records in your devices' calendar.
